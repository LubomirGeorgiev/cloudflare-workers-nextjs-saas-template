# Actionable Improvement Tasks

This document lists potential tasks based on the "Potential Areas for Improvement" identified in the `CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md` report.

## Performance Tasks
- [ ] **Complex Database Queries:** The multi-tenancy features (teams, roles, permissions) can lead to complex SQL queries. Monitor for slow queries, especially those involving multiple joins across `teamTable`, `teamMembershipTable`, and `teamRoleTable`.
- [ ] **N+1 Problem Potential:** The `getUserTeamsWithPermissions` function in `src/utils/auth.ts` iterates through team memberships and fetches role details. While Drizzle ORM might batch some queries, explicitly check if this leads to multiple database calls (N+1) for users in many teams with custom roles. Consider pre-fetching or optimizing this data retrieval.
- [ ] **Session Validation Overhead:** While KV is fast and `React.cache` helps per request, `validateSessionToken` (which involves a KV read) is on the critical path for authenticated requests. For extremely high-traffic scenarios, the aggregate load on KV and latency impact might need observation.
- [ ] **Real-time Feature Impact:** The project plan mentions "Real-time updates" as an "In Progress" feature. The chosen technology and implementation for real-time will have significant performance implications to consider (e.g., WebSocket server load, message frequency, data serialization).
- [ ] **Cold Starts:** Serverless functions (Cloudflare Workers) can experience cold starts. While usually minimal, for applications requiring consistent low latency, this might be a factor to monitor, especially for less frequently accessed functions. OpenNext and Cloudflare Workers aim to minimize this.

## Cleanliness Tasks
- [ ] **ESLint Configuration:** The current ESLint setup (`eslint.config.mjs`) primarily extends `next/core-web-vitals` and `next/typescript`. It does not appear to have custom rules configured to automatically enforce many of the specific coding style guidelines documented in `.cursor/rules/005-code-style.mdc` (e.g., requiring named object parameters for functions with >1 argument, specific function keyword usage). This means adherence to these custom rules currently relies on developer diligence rather than automated linting. (Recommendation: Enhance the ESLint configuration with plugins or custom rules to automatically enforce the project-specific guidelines from `.cursor/rules/`.)
- [ ] **Build Process Overrides:** The `next.config.mjs` allows skipping ESLint and TypeScript error checks during builds via the `SKIP_LINTER=true` environment variable (`eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: ... }`, `typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: ... }`). This poses a risk to code quality and could allow deployment of code that violates defined standards or contains type errors. (Recommendation: Remove the `SKIP_LINTER=true` capability or restrict its use to very specific, controlled, and temporary debugging scenarios. Builds pushed to staging or production should always enforce linting and type checking.)
- [ ] **Adherence to "Interfaces over Types":** While `.cursor/rules/006-typescript-conventions.mdc` states "prefer interfaces over types," Drizzle ORM's `InferSelectModel` generates `type` aliases. This is a minor point and an artifact of the library, but worth noting for consistency if strict adherence is desired elsewhere. For manually defined types, ensure interfaces are preferred.

## Security Tasks
- [ ] **Authorization Logic Implementation:** While the schema supports RBAC, the actual enforcement of permissions in server-side logic (e.g., in files under `src/server/`) needs to be thoroughly verified. For example, ensuring that a user modifying a team resource is actually a member of that team and has the required permissions. (Recommendation: Conduct a specific audit of all server-side operations that involve resource access or modification to ensure that appropriate authorization checks based on session data and team/role permissions are consistently applied.)
- [ ] **Rate Limiting Details:** The project documentation mentions "rate limiting for API endpoints" as a completed feature. However, the specifics of this implementation (e.g., which endpoints are covered, the types of limits, configurability, protection against different types of abuse like login brute-forcing) were not visible in the reviewed files. (Recommendation: Document the rate-limiting strategy and implementation details. Verify its effectiveness against common abuse patterns.)
- [ ] **Dependency Vulnerability Management:** Like any project, dependencies can introduce vulnerabilities. (Recommendation: Implement a regular process for scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `pnpm audit`, Snyk, or GitHub Dependabot) and promptly update or mitigate them.)
- [ ] **Impact of `SKIP_LINTER=true`:** As mentioned in "Cleanliness," allowing builds to skip linting and type checking can indirectly pose a security risk if it allows code with potential vulnerabilities (that static analysis might have caught) to be deployed. (Recommendation: Reinforce the importance of removing or strictly controlling this option.)
- [ ] **Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs:** Ensure that sensitive information (e.g., session tokens, raw passwords, excessive PII) is not inadvertently logged, especially in production. Review logging statements throughout the application. (No specific issues seen, but a general best practice).
- [ ] **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While Next.js provides some defaults, consider implementing a stricter Content Security Policy via headers to further mitigate XSS attacks, especially if integrating third-party scripts.
- [ ] **Security Headers:** Review and ensure other important security headers (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options) are appropriately configured for the application, often handled at the edge by Cloudflare.
